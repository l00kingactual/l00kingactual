'''
Supervised Learning:
Random Forests: Good for classification tasks, such as star/galaxy separation.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Useful for high-dimensional spaces, often used in star/galaxy classification.
Linear Regression: For simpler tasks like estimating distances.
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN): Useful for classification tasks based on feature similarity.

Unsupervised Learning:
K-Means Clustering: For grouping objects based on their features, such as galaxies based on their shapes.
Hierarchical Clustering: Useful for creating a tree of nested clusters.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): For dimensionality reduction, especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional data like spectra.

Neural Networks:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image-based tasks like galaxy morphological classification.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For time-series data, like light curves of stars.
Autoencoders: For anomaly detection, such as identifying unusual celestial objects.

Reinforcement Learning:
Q-Learning: For tasks that involve sequential decision-making, although this is less commonly applied in astronomy.

 Methods:
Boosting and Bagging: To improve the performance of other algorithms.

Specialized Algorithms:
Gaussian Processes: For regression problems, often used in light curve analysis.
Bayesian Networks: For probabilistic graphical models, useful in cosmological parameter estimation.
